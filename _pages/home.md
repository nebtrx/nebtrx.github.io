I'm a Software Engineer. A full time geek and a passionate tech lover. I [code](https://github.com/nebtrx/), [write(a little)](/blog), [test Android ROMs](http://forum.xda-developers.com/search.php?searchid=429100021), learn and listen. I also love to take photographies, watch sci fi movies, [play Overwatch](http://masteroverwatch.com/profile/pc/us/nebtrx-1639) and discuss about technology.

I spent my last year been part of the amazing [Stackbuilders](https://www.stackbuilders.com/) team, learning a lot of [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [empowering Twilio developers](/twilio-tutorials) to build incredible web and native apps that make communication better
