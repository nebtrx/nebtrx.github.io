This post is quick because I'm in a rush but despite this I didn't want to lose the opportunity because I have tons of work to be done and lack of time to blogging. Right now I'm working in a custom Silverlight Player based on the [Silverlight Media Platform: Player Framework](http://smf.codeplex.com/ "Silverlight Media Platform: Player Framework ") (SMPPF) and I decided to release part of the involved code as a side package called Sidewired which may result very useful for those lazy developers aiming to exploit all the advantages of SMPPF(chapters, timeline markers, ads, captions, etc.), without having to code a way in to inject all the available media content into the player. Turns out that those who had play with SMPPF knows very well the lack of usability of the actual API used to provide the media content to the player through the Silverlight HTML Object.

So, I don’t delay this anymore, and as good developers knows, there is no evil in reusing, so I’ll beg the pardon of all you readers but I’ll reuse the project documentation written by myself and I’m redirecting you to [Sidewired Home Site](https://bitbucket.og/nebtrx/sidewired "Sidewired Project Home")[  
](https://bitbucket.og/nebtrx/sidewired "Sidewired Project Home")

I hope it result useful for those interested and you guys give it a try in spite of my informality.  
Best regards.
