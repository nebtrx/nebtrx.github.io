Hi folks, I recently moved to Windows 8 and it was a nightmare when trying to publish some web or developing with Silverlight using the brand new 8th version of IIS. Finally after so much ripping, reading and fixing I've found a basic stable configuration for .Net developing using the pair Windows 8 - ISS 8 that works nice for me and I want to share with you guys ;) before you lose a kidney in the attempt, as I almost did.

So, with no more words, follow my crumbs: Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off and then check the options as the image shows. For a more philosophical approach check [here](http://www.iis.net/learn/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-8/iis-80-using-aspnet-35-and-aspnet-45),Â and of course, feel free to make suggestions.
